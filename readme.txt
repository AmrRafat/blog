This is a demo project of a blog.

In this blog you will be able to login as a member and as a moderator.

As a member, you will be able to post a new subject for discussion, comment on subjects as well and delete subjects you posted earlier if you would like.
Of course as a member you have a profile where you can let other members know more about you.

As a moderator, you will be able to check the subjects and approve the subject to be posted.
You will have the ability to delete subjects or comments against the policy of the blog and that will send an automatic warning to the member.
